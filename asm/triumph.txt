PRINT This was a triumph!
PRINT I'm making a note here:
PRINT Huge success!\n

PRINT It's hard to overstate
PRINT my satisfaction.\n

PRINT Aperture Science:
PRINT We do what we must
PRINT because we can
PRINT For the good of all of us.
PRINT Except the ones who are dead.\n

PRINT But there's no sense crying
PRINT over every mistake.
PRINT You just keep on trying
PRINT 'til you run out of cake.
PRINT And the science gets done.
PRINT And you make a neat gun
PRINT for the people who are
PRINT still alive.\n

PRINT I'm not even angry...
PRINT I'm being so sincere right now.
PRINT Even though you broke my heart,
PRINT and killed me.\n

PRINT And tore me to pieces.
PRINT And threw every piece into a fire.
PRINT As they burned it hurt because
PRINT I was so happy for you!\n

PRINT Now, these points of data
PRINT make a beautiful line.
PRINT And we're out of beta.
PRINT We're releasing on time!
PRINT So I'm GLaD I got burned!
PRINT Think of all the things we learned!
PRINT for the people who are
PRINT still alive.\n

PRINT Go ahead and leave me...
PRINT I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
PRINT Maybe you'll find someone else
PRINT to help you.
PRINT Maybe Black Mesa?
PRINT That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!\n

PRINT Anyway this cake is great!
PRINT It's so delicious and moist!\n

PRINT Look at me: still talking
PRINT when there's science to do!
PRINT When I look out there,
PRINT it makes me glad I'm not you.\n

PRINT I've experiments to run.
PRINT There is research to be done.
PRINT On the people who are
PRINT still alive.
PRINT And believe me I am
PRINT still alive.
PRINT I'm doing science and I'm
PRINT still alive.
PRINT I feel fantastic and I'm
PRINT still alive.
PRINT While you're dying I'll be
PRINT still alive.
PRINT And when you're dead I will be
PRINT still alive\n

PRINT Still alive.\n

PRINT Still alive.
