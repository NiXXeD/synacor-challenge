OUT This was a triumph!
OUT I'm making a note here:
OUT Huge success!\n

OUT It's hard to overstate
OUT my satisfaction.\n

OUT Aperture Science:
OUT We do what we must
OUT because we can
OUT For the good of all of us.
OUT Except the ones who are dead.\n

OUT But there's no sense crying
OUT over every mistake.
OUT You just keep on trying
OUT 'til you run out of cake.
OUT And the science gets done.
OUT And you make a neat gun
OUT for the people who are
OUT still alive.\n

OUT I'm not even angry...
OUT I'm being so sincere right now.
OUT Even though you broke my heart,
OUT and killed me.\n

OUT And tore me to pieces.
OUT And threw every piece into a fire.
OUT As they burned it hurt because
OUT I was so happy for you!\n

OUT Now, these points of data
OUT make a beautiful line.
OUT And we're out of beta.
OUT We're releasing on time!
OUT So I'm GLaD I got burned!
OUT Think of all the things we learned!
OUT for the people who are
OUT still alive.\n

OUT Go ahead and leave me...
OUT I think I'd prefer to stay inside...
OUT Maybe you'll find someone else
OUT to help you.
OUT Maybe Black Mesa?
OUT That was a joke. Ha Ha. Fat Chance!\n

OUT Anyway this cake is great!
OUT It's so delicious and moist!\n

OUT Look at me: still talking
OUT when there's science to do!
OUT When I look out there,
OUT it makes me glad I'm not you.\n

OUT I've experiments to run.
OUT There is research to be done.
OUT On the people who are
OUT still alive.
OUT And believe me I am
OUT still alive.
OUT I'm doing science and I'm
OUT still alive.
OUT I feel fantastic and I'm
OUT still alive.
OUT While you're dying I'll be
OUT still alive.
OUT And when you're dead I will be
OUT still alive\n

OUT Still alive.\n

OUT Still alive.
